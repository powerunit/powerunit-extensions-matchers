<title>Powerunit Extensions Matchers</title>

<body>
	This is an extension to Powerunit to generate matchers for POJO.
	<p />
	This library provides several annotation processors :
	<ul>
		<li><b>Processing of the ProvideMatchers annotation.</b><br />This
			processor create <code>Matcher</code> for each annotated class, in
			the following way :
			<ul>
				<li>For public field, create a dedicated matcher, accessing
					this field by using direct access.</li>
				<li>For method named <i>getXXX</i>, which haven't any parameter
					and return something, assume this is a field and create a dedicated
					matcher, accessing it by using this method.
				</li>
				<li>For method named <i>isXXX</i>, which haven't any parameter
					and return something, assume this is a field and create a dedicated
					matcher, accessing it by using this method.
				</li>
				<li>If this class extends another one (outside <i>Object</i>),
					a special matcher will be created to check the super class
					information.
				</li>
				<li>Create one (or two if a super class exists) methods to
					build the matcher. These method are named based on the class name,
					followed by <i>with</i>.
				</li>
				<li>Create dedicated method to compare, using matcher, on
					object with another.</li>
				<li>For some specific type, add method to do some matching with
					more clean name, like XXXIsPresent for an Optional.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><b>Processing of the Factory annotation (from hamcrest).</b><br />
			<i>This processor requires to set the parameter <code>ch.powerunit.extensions.matchers.factoryprocessor.FactoryAnnotationsProcessor.targets</code>
				(<code>-A</code> parameter).
		</i><br />This processor create <code>DSL</code> interface for each
			method annotated, in the following way :
			<ul>
				<li>Static method annotated with the <code>Factory</code>
					annotation are exposed in an interface, based on the mapping
					defined by the parameter.
				</li>
				<li>The parameter is a list (; separated) on target block,
					which defines a mapping between regular expression (, separated)
					and a target class (separated with a :)</li>
			</ul></li>
	</ul>
